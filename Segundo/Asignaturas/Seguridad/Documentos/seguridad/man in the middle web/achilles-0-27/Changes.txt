Changes From Releaes .16.b to Release .27

1. Changed window from dialog box to window so it's now resizable.
2. Much improved performance in intercept mode when Intercept Server Data is not checked.
3. Added client log and server log windows. This may do away with the log to text file. In future
    versions.
4. Added a find button. 
5. Currently defaults to system fonts, but added the ability to change this for the main edit window. Dont
    want to get too bogged down with graphical interface at this time.

Future Releases (roughly in order)
1. Proxy Chaining. (Past Due, will be out very soon)
2. Log Key elements to a Database. This will allow for querying, replaying and report generation.
3. Automated Rules for changing data on the fly.
4. Security Settings. Basically a host allow list.
5. Check server certificates.
6. New skin, prettiness in general.
